# Chat-bot
This is a simple chat room application for users to interact using a locally hosted server.Single and multiple users can hop on and freely send and recieve messages from each other.

## Technologies used -
1. HTML and CSS are used to create the Document Object Structure, Markup, content and, styling. 

2. JavaScript is used for scripting, used in client and server. 

## Before you use - 

Please note that this application is prone to be flagged by a preflight safety system in browser called the CORs protocol. This application is not deployment ready, it is only a developer prototype. 

About the CORs prolicy:
Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) is an extension of the same-origin policy. You need it for authorized resource sharing with external third parties. For example, you need CORS when you want to pull data from external APIs that are public or authorized.

Eventhough this application has allowed free transmition using "*", as well as the appropriate CORs headers, I have noticed it has not fully solved the problem.


Best Solution: I would recommend using an extension like Moesif, to enable and disable CORs during your testing process. Understand the importancy of CORs before using this and do not forget to turn it back on after testing is complete, as it is essential for the security of your device.
